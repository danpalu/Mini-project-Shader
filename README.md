 For CGP.

This Unity project contains a shader and a simple scene, showing off the shader. The shader tries to mimick handdrawn hatching shading. It has a lot of settings for tuning how you want the shader to look, like the scale of the texture, cutoff and so on. The Tune setting adjusts the weight of each hatching pattern - how visible they will be. Base color and hatching(shadow) color can be changed too. And the basics like specular and ambient light.

- Drag the textures in the slots in material properties
